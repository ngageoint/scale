            version of the configuration used. This allows updates to be made to |
            the specification while maintaining backwards compatibility by allowing |
            Scale to recognize an older version and convert it to the current version. |
            The default value for version if it is not included is the latest version, |
            which is currently 1.0. It is recommended, though not required, that you |
            include the version so that future changes to the specification will still |
            accept your workspace configuration.

            The other fields that configure the broker are based upon the type of the broker in the|

        host_path:
          type: string
          description: The host_path is a required string that specifies the absolute path of the |
            host’s local directory that should be mounted into a job’s container in order to |
            access the workspace’s files.
          example: /the/absolute/host/path

      type: object
      properties:
        nfs_path:
          type: string
          description: The nfs_path is a required string that specifies the remote NFS path to use |
            for storing and retrieving the workspace files. It should be in the format host:/path.
          example: host:/my/path
      required:

            name of a storage bucket within S3. The bucket should be created before attempting to use it here.
          example: my_bucket.domain.com
        credentials:
          $ref: '#/components/schemas/credentials'
        host_path:
          type: string
          description: The host_path is an optional string that adds S3 workspace support for |
            locally mounted buckets and partial file read-only access. If a FUSE file system |
            (such as s3fs or goofys) mounts the S3 bucket at the host_path location on all nodes, |
            an alternative to downloading large files is available to jobs that use only portions |
            of a file. The job interface must indicate partial equal to true for any input files |
            to take advantage of host_path. Only read operations are performed using the mount, |
            all write operations will use the S3 REST API.
          example: /my_bucket
        region_name:
          type: string
          description: The region_name is an optional string that specifies the AWS region where the |
            SQS Queue is located. This is not always required, as environment variables or configuration |
            files could set the default region, but it is a highly recommended setting for explicitly |
            indicating the SQS region.
          example: us-east-1
      required:
      - bucket_name
      
    credentials:
      title: Credentials
      type: object
      description: The credentials is a JSON object that provides the necessary information to access |
        the bucket. This attribute should be omitted when using IAM role-based security. If it is |
        included for key-based security, then both sub-attributes must be included. An IAM account |
        should be created and granted the appropriate permissions to the bucket before attempting to use it here.
      properties:
        access_key_id:
          type: string
          description: The access_key_id is a unique identifier for the user account in IAM that will |
            be used as a proxy for read and write operations within Scale.
          example: AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE
        secret_access_key:
          type: string
          description: The secret_access_key is a generated token that the system can use to prove it |
            should be able to make requests on behalf of the associated IAM account without requiring |
            the actual password used by that account.
          example: wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY
