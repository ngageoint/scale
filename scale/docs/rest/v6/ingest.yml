      type: object
      properties:

          type: string
          description: The type is a required string that specifies the type of the scanner to use.
            The other fields that configure the scanner are based upon the type of the scanner in the type field.
            Certain scanner types may only be used on workspaces with corresponding broker types. The valid scanner types are dir and s3
          example: dir
        transfer_suffix:
          type: string
          description: The transfer_suffix field is an optional string that defines a suffix that is
            used on the file names to indicate that files are still transferring and have not yet finished
            being copied into the scanned directory. Only used with dir scanners.

    ingest_file:
      title: File Ingest Rule
      type: object
      properties:
        filename_regex:
          type: string
          description: The filename_regex field is a required string that defines a regular expression to check against
            the names of new files in the scanned workspace. When a new file appears in the workspace, the file’s name
            is checked against each expression in order of the files_to_ingest array. If an expression matches the new
            file name in the workspace, that file is ingested according to the other fields in the JSON object and all
            subsequent rules in the list are ignored (first rule matched is applied).
          example: "*.txt"
        data_types:
          type: array
          style: simple
          items:
            type: string
          description: The data_types field is an optional list of strings. Any file that matches the corresponding file
            name regular expression will have these data type strings “tagged” with the file. If not provided, data_types
            defaults to an empty array.
          example: []
        new_workspace:
          type: string
          description: The new_workspace field optionally specifies the name of a new workspace to which the file should
            be copied. This allows the ingest process to move files to a different workspace after they appear in the
            scanned workspace.
          example: my-new-workspace
        new_file_path:
          type: string
          description: The new_file_path field is an optional string that specifies a new relative path for storing new
            files. If new_workspace is also specified, the file is moved to the new workspace at this new path location
            (instead of using the current path the new file originally came in on). If new_workspace is not specified,
            the file is moved to this new path location within the original scanned workspace. In either of these cases,
            three additional and dynamically named directories, for the current year, month, and day, will be appended to
            the new_file_path value automatically by the Scale system (i.e. workspace_path/YYYY/MM/DD).
          example: the/new/path/

    dir_monitor:

          description: The type is a required string that specifies the type of monitor to use.
            The other fields that configure the monitor are based upon the type of the monitor in the type field.
            Certain monitor types may only be used on workspaces with corresponding broker types. The valid
            monitor types are dir-watcher and s3
          example: dir-watcher
        transfer_suffix:
          type: string
          description: The transfer_suffix field is an optional string that defines a suffix that is
            used on the file names to indicate that files are still transferring and have not yet finished
            being copied into the scanned directory. Only used with dir monitors.
          example: _tmp

        sqs_name:
          type: string
          description: The sqs_name field is a required string that defines the name of the SQS queue

          example: my-sqs
        credentials:
          $ref: './workspace.yml#/components/schemas/credentials'
        region_name:
          type: string
          description: The region_name is an optional string that specifies the AWS region where the
            SQS Queue is located. This is not always required, as environment variables or configuration
            files could set the default region, but it is a highly recommended setting for explicitly
            indicating the SQS region.
          example: us-east-1
      required:
      - type
