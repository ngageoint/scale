.. rubric:: `Scale <https://github.com/ngageoint/scale/>`_ is an open source system that provides management of 
            automated processing on a cluster of machines. It allows users to define jobs, which can be any type of 
            script or algorithm. These jobs run on ingested source data and produce product files. The produced products 
            can be disseminated to appropriate users and/or used to evaluate the producing algorithm in terms of 
            performance and accuracy.

Scale was developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with 
`Ball Aerospace <http://www.ballaerospace.com/>`_ and `Applied Information Sciences (AIS) <http://www.appliedis.com/>`_.
