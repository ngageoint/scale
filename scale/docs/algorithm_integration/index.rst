Algorithm Integration into Scale
========================================================================================================================
This document explains the steps necessary to integrate an algorithm into the Scale system. The Scale system utilizes
Docker containers to run algorithms in an isolated environment. This guide will document the steps necessary for getting an application ready for Scale integration, creating a docker container and capturing outputs, and 
putting the Job into Scale and into a Recipe.


Here are the steps for integrating an algorithm into Scale:
